# Experiment 10
# C++ Pointers Exploration

## Objective
To investigate and apply pointers in C++ for effective memory management, data manipulation, and optimized data handling.

## Tools and Technologies
- **IDE**: Any C++ compatible IDE
- **Operators**: Address-of (`&`), Dereference (`*`)
- **Concepts**: Variables, memory addresses, pointer arithmetic

## Background
Pointers in C++ are special variables that hold memory addresses of other variables, enabling direct access and modification of data in memory. They are essential for efficient memory use and are widely used in:

- Allocating memory dynamically
- Passing large data structures to functions
- Handling arrays and strings
- Creating advanced data structures like linked lists or graphs

## Key Concepts

### 1. Understanding Pointers
A pointer stores the memory address of a variable. Key operators include:
- `&` to obtain a variable's memory address
- `*` to access or modify the value at a memory address

**Syntax**:
```cpp
type *pointerName;
